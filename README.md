# Design-of-45-nm-CMOS-standard-cell-Library


-	Designed standard cells like NAND, NOR, XOR, MUX, etc using given W/L parameters.
- Generated the schematic followed by a symbol, functional view, and layout with clean DRC and LVS clean.
- For the layout, only Metal1 and Metal2 are used.
- Measured the rising and falling delay of the output.
-	Also measured rising and falling propagation delay.
-	Making sure to use minimum area for every layout.
